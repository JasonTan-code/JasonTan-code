    <description><![CDATA[Introduction This series of blog posts is aiming to discuss the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), given its wide applications in various fields including natural language processing, population genetics, finance, and so on. Besides its usefulness, I found HMM particularly interesting to learn, since it connects multiple disciplines like probability, linear algebra, machine learning and computer science. In this post, I will introduce Markov Model, which serves as the backbone of HMM model.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Introduction Bayesian network, a probabilistic model that represents the causal relationship between variables, has gain its popularity in various fields. In biology, for example, people start to use this model to infer genetic regulatory network (GRN) due to its nice property of being directional. The aim of this blog post is to provide a gentle and less-mathematical introduction to Bayesian network.
Â An example Suppose we are going to take a math exam next week.]]></description>
